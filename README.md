# Hearthstone Fatigue Calculator
Just a handy fatigue calculator, pretty useful when you're playing mill rogue or similar stuff and you're too lazy to calculate the lethal damage. 
It's just a console program because I don't have the time to make it look fancy, but I make an interface if this gets more attention, or try to turn it into a Heartstone Deck Tracker plugin

## Modes
1. You input the damage you need to get lethal, you get the turns needed
2. You input the fatigue turns, you get the damage you'll get from fatigue
* Also works if the fatigue damage isn't starting at 1

# Hearthstone Fatigue Calculator
Just a handy fatigue calculator, pretty useful when you're playing mill rogue or similar stuff and you're too lazy to calculate the lethal damage. 
It's just a console program because I don't have the time to make it look fancy, but I make an interface if this gets more attention, or try to turn it into a Heartstone Deck Tracker plugin

# Modes
* You give the damage you need to get lethal, you get the turns needed (works with the option 1 in the program)
* You give the turns you are going to fatigue, you get the damage you'll get from fatigue (works with option 2 in the program)

# Hearthstone Fatigue Calculator
Just a handy fatigue calculator, pretty useful when you're playing Mill Rogue or similar stuff and you're too lazy to calculate the lethal damage.

## Modes
1. You input the damage you need to get lethal, and you get the turns needed
2. You input the fatigue turns, you get the damage you'll get from fatigue
* You get to choose the initial fatigue damage in both modes
